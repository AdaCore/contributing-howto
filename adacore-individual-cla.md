# AdaCore Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") V1

Thank you for your interest in one of the projects managed by AdaCore SAS or Ada Core Technologies Inc (together "AdaCore"). In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, AdaCore must have an AdaCore Individual Contributor License Agreement ("AICLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of AdaCore and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.  

If you have not already approved electronically this Agreement, please complete and sign, then scan and email a pdf file of it to contributions@adacore.com. Please read this document carefully before signing, and keep a copy for your records.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to AdaCore. In return, AdaCore shall only make Your Contributions available to third parties under terms that meet [the definition of Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) of the Free Software Foundation, or [the Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd) of the Open Source initiative, which You otherwise know. 

Except for the licenses granted herein to AdaCore and recipients of software distributed by AdaCore, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. Definitions.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with AdaCore. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition,
"control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to AdaCore for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by AdaCore (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of conveyance to AdaCore or its representatives, including but not limited to verbal or written communication, communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, AdaCore for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution." You agree that journaling information stored on AdaCore computers is legal evidence of Your submissions. 

â€œDistributing" shall refer both to the act of explicitly conveying software from one entity to another and to the act of placing the software in a public repository with the intent that other entities shall download that software.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to AdaCore and to recipients of software Distributed by AdaCore a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your
Contributions and such derivative works for any purpose.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to AdaCore and to recipients of software Distributed by AdaCore a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, sublicense and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license or sublicenses applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. AdaCore may define the conditions under which any patent licenses granted under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work to a third party shall be revoked.

4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to AdaCore, or that your employer has
executed a separate Corporate Contributor License Agreement with AdaCore.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).  You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contribution.  You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Should You wish to include work that is not Your original creation, You must request permission from AdaCore to submit that material, identifying the nature of the work, complete details of its original author  and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware.  You must not send the work to AdaCore until permission has been received to do so.

8.  If at any time after you sign this agreement, you become aware of any facts or circumstances that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect, you agree to immediately notify AdaCore of these facts or circumstances.

9. You agree that this agreement may be electronically signed. You agree that the electronic signatures appearing on this agreement are the same as handwritten signatures for the purposes of validity, enforceability and admissibility.
